# scoutarr

Scoutarr automates media upgrades in your Starr applications (Radarr, Sonarr, Lidarr, and Readarr) by performing manual or automatic searches for media items that meet your criteria and tagging what was searched, so you can continuously chase better quality releases without babysitting your apps.

> **Note:** This project uses [Upgradinatorr](https://github.com/angrycuban13/Just-A-Bunch-Of-Starr-Scripts/tree/main/Upgradinatorr) as its foundation. We've created a modern UI and enhanced the functionality while maintaining the core concept.

- 📝 **Structured Logging** – Organized debugging logs with Winston

## Requirements

- Node.js 20+
- Docker (optional, for containerized deployment)

## Quick Start

### Development

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Start development servers:
```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Open http://localhost:7291 in your browser

### Docker

1. Build and run with Docker Compose:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

2. Open http://localhost:5839 in your browser

#### Docker Compose Example

```yaml
services:
  scoutarr:
    image: ghcr.io/sufxgit/scoutarr:latest
    container_name: scoutarr
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "5839:5839"
    volumes:
      - ./config:/app/config
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=production
      - TZ=America/New_York
      - LOG_LEVEL=info
```

### Logging

The application uses Winston for structured logging with organized, color-coded output:

- **Console Output**: Color-coded logs with timestamps for easy debugging
- **File Logs**: JSON-formatted logs saved to `logs/` directory:
  - `combined.log` - All logs
  - `error.log` - Error logs only
  - `exceptions.log` - Uncaught exceptions
  - `rejections.log` - Unhandled promise rejections

**Log Levels:**
- `error` - Errors that need attention
- `warn` - Warnings
- `info` - General information
- `http` - HTTP requests/responses
- `debug` - Detailed debugging information

**Environment Variable:**
- `LOG_LEVEL` - Set log level (default: `debug` in development, `info` in production)

## Configuration

Configuration is stored in `config/config.json`. On first run, the application will create a default configuration file based on `config/config.example.json`.

### Config Structure

```json
{
  "notifications": {
    "discordWebhook": "",
    "notifiarrPassthroughWebhook": "",
    "notifiarrPassthroughDiscordChannelId": "",
    "pushoverUserKey": "",
    "pushoverApiToken": ""
  },
  "applications": {
    "radarr": [],
    "sonarr": [],
    "lidarr": [],
    "readarr": []
  },
  "scheduler": {
    "enabled": false,
    "schedule": "0 */6 * * *",
    "unattended": false
  }
}
```

## How It Works

1. **Configure** – Set up your Radarr, Sonarr, Lidarr, and Readarr instances, filters, and scheduler in the Settings page.
2. **Run** – Start a search manually from the Dashboard or let the scheduler run automatically.
